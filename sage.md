# BFME

The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth is an RTS game centered around the LotR universe using the aesthetic from the Peter Jackson movies (in the first game) and then their own inspirations for the second game and expansion. It's a game dear to my heart and I have grown quite fond of the community. In an attempt to keep this community alive I have poured a lot of time coding tools to make it easier to maintain the various projects I created. These projects are explained and linked below:

## Ini Parser

A recent project that is barely in its first phase. The idea is to be able to parse all the objects used in BFME so as to be able to manipulate them using code for example to get stats. More coming soon.

## Big Parse

The idea for this tool is to be able to manipulate .big files programatically so as to be able to compile them automatically. More coming soon.

## AotR Launcher

**Discontinued**. An interesting project to create a lightweight installer and launcher for Age of the Ring. The launcher had for task to launch the game using the -mod command, handle the link with gameranger and update the mod using the files stored in Drive. I faced two major issues:
* adding the right binaries so that everyone can run the launcher is complicated
* Google doesn't like people using their Drive system for widespread file distribution

## Edain Searcher Scraper

An autogui script to scrape data from the Edain Searcher, which is, to date, the only tool that I know that can parse these files and retrieve the correct data. This is very handy to autogenerate Wiki templates to update the appropriate pages on the wiki.
