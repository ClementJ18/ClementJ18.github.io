A place where where I put stuff to show off. 

## mod.io

A wrapper for the [mod.io](https://mod.io/) API, with a sync and async version. Both use the same documentation but coroutines in the async package will be marked as such in the documentation.

* [Docs](https://modio.readthedocs.io)
* [Support](https://discord.gg/Hkq7X7n)
* [Repository](https://github.com/ClementJ18/mod.io)

## moddb

A site wide scrapper for [ModDB.com](https://www.moddb.com/) with the goal of being able to navigate the entire site programatically, kinda like if the site was actually just one giant API.

## necrobot

A python discord bot that does some cool stuff, provides moderation tools, social commands, an economy system unique to each server and LOTR related commands.

## SAGE Engine

I'm a big fan of the Battle for Middle Earth Series and a few of the tools I've designed have been inspired by a desire to interact with these games and the engine form a programatical point of view so I've grouped all of them under a single page.

* Ini Parser: A tool to parse BFME inis and transform them into python objects for easy manipulation of game stats and code. (Incomplete)
* Custom Shortcut: A simple project to outgrew its initial name, a tool to parse the .BIG file type to be able to manipulate the files within
* AotR Launcher: An attempt at making a launcher with only updating capabilities of the Age of the Ring Mod, failed maninly because deploying applications on a large scale is hard with Python and because Google isn't overly fond of me using their Drive system as a storage system for widespread file distribution.
* Edain Scraper: An autogui tool that scrapes the Edain Searcher to be able to access unit stats programatically, a cheap way of using somebody's else work on Ini parsing to my advantage.
