# ClemNet

A place where libraries I create are documented.

## mod.io

A wrapper for the [mod.io](https://mod.io/) API, with a sync and async version. Both use the same documentation but coroutines in the async package will be marked as such in the documentation.

## moddb

A site wide scrapper for [ModDB.com](https://www.moddb.com/) with the goal of being able to navigate the entire site progrmatically.
